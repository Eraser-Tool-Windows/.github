## What is Eraser?

**Eraser** is a powerful, open-source security tool for Windows that allows users to **permanently delete** sensitive data from their hard drives. Unlike standard deletion, which only removes file pointers, Eraser overwrites the data multiple times with random patterns, making it **unrecoverable** even with advanced forensic tools.

With Eraser, you can securely:
- Permanently erase files, folders, and even free disk space.
- Use multiple secure deletion algorithms (e.g., Gutmann, DoD 5220.22-M).
- Schedule erasure tasks for automated cleanups.
- Ensure compliance with data protection policies.

Eraser is an essential tool for privacy-conscious users, IT professionals, and organizations that require certified data destruction methods. By integrating with Windows Explorer, it provides a straightforward way to maintain data hygiene and prevent sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands.
